==========================

	The Instructions.Guide file used the following language syntax in order to form the command structure for the GRPL Tool, as following: 

	COMMAND   [OPTION]   [CONDITION]

	Where:
	
	COMMAND 	The name of the command which identifies its functionality, like: Run, Stop,  Load, Check, or Loop.
	
	OPTION 		The elected choice for the COMMAND to optionally operate, like: True or False.
	
	CONDITION	The auxiliary state for the COMMAND to conditionally operate, 	like Sensors, Actuators, Colors or Numbers.

	For example:
	
	load >> variable >> number:color:true:false

	Where:
	
	>>	used to separate between COMMAND, OPTION, and CONDITION.
	
	:		used to separate many choices in OPTION or CONDITION.

	Hints:
	?		used to comment a single line.
	
	The COMMAND should be mentioned first in the language syntax, then followed by OPTION and CONDITION, or vice versa.
	
	The “instructions.guide” is not a case-sensitive file.
